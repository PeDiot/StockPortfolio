# StockPortfolio

The project aims to build a stock portfolio monitoring tool to help you boosting your returns. The app provides multiple data visualizations and financial analysis. The input data comes from the Yahoo Finance website. Ten French companies have been selected. Feel free to modify the source code in order to select your own assets. 

The app can be viewed by clicking on this [link](https://pdiot.shinyapps.io/StockPortfolio/).

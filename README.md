# StockPortfolio

The project aims to build a stock portfolio monitoring tool to help you boosting your returns. The app provides multiple data visualizations and financial analysis. The input data comes from the Yahoo Finance website. Ten French companies have been selected in the demo app. Feel free to modify the source code in order to select your own assets. 

The app can be viewed by clicking on this [link](https://pdiot.shinyapps.io/StockPortfolio/).

In the `TODO` folder, you will find python & R scripts we built in order to predict future stock prices. We managed to implement a neural network which outputs 5-day price predictions for ten French stocks. However, we didn't succeed in deploying the app with the predictions. Any help is therefore welcome to advance on this interesting project!
